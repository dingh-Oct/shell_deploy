CMake Error at cmake/boost.cmake:81 (MESSAGE):
  You can download it with -DDOWNLOAD_BOOST=1 -DWITH_BOOST=<directory>

  This CMake script will look for boost in <directory>.  If it is not there,
  it will download and unpack it (in that directory) for you.

  If you are inside a firewall, you may need to use an http proxy:

  export http_proxy=http://example.com:80

Call Stack (most recent call first):
